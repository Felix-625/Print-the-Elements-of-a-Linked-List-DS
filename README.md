# Print-the-Elements-of-a-Linked-List-DS

This C# code defines a singly linked list with nodes containing integer data and a pointer to the next node. The SinglyLinkedList class manages the list by allowing nodes to be inserted at the end. The printLinkedList function traverses the list from the head and prints each node's data on a new line. The Main method reads input values, constructs the linked list, and then calls printLinkedList to display the stored values sequentially.
